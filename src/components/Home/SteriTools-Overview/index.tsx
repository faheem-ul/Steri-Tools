          innovative solution engineered to enhance surgical protocols by

          This technology minimizes bioburden left on instruments and reduces
          the workload in sterile processing departments, improving tray
          turnover and saving valuable time.
          <br /> <br />
          This innovative device boasts a military spec rugged and lightweight
          design, making it easily portable for forward surgical teams in
          austere environments. Its battery powered operation, supported by
          rechargeable batteries, ensures flexibility and convenience,
          eliminating the reliance on fixed power sources. Additionally,
          SteriBasin Go is designed to work seamlessly with a consumable kit
          that is replaced for each patient, reinforcing optimal aseptic
          technique.
          <br />
          <br />
          Tailored for military applications, SteriBasin Go technology is also
          scalable for civilian hospital use, positioning it as a versatile
          solution for enhancing surgical efficiency and safety across various
          settings.
